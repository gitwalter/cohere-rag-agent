       "<p>The theory of Kahnemann and Tversky is a collection of cognitive biases that affect how people make decisions and form beliefs. The theory covers a wide range of topics, including memory, decision-making, and behavioral economics. Here is a brief summary of their theory:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Heuristics and Biases: Kahnemann and Tversky proposed that people often rely on heuristics or mental shortcuts to make decisions, rather than rigorously weighing all available evidence. These heuristics can lead to cognitive biases, where errors in judgment arise due to systematic deviations from strict rationality. Some common biases include the availability heuristic (relying on easily recalled examples), representativeness heuristic (making judgments based on similarities to a reference class), and confirmation bias (seeking out information that supports existing beliefs).</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Prospect Theory: This theory explains how people choose between options that involve risk, like potential gains or losses. It challenges the assumption that individuals are always risk-averse, presenting a model that differentiates between choices involving certain outcomes and choices involving uncertain ones. The theory suggests that individuals tend to avoid losses and take more risks when facing potential losses, a phenomenon known as \"loss aversion.\" </p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Cognitive Reflection Task: Kahnemann and Tversky introduced this task as a measure of individual differences in decision-making. It involves a set of problems where a quick answer leads to an incorrect answer, requiring participants to suppress their intuitive response and engage in more careful cognitive reflection to arrive at the correct solution. The task has been used to study the interplay between intuitive and reflective forms of reasoning.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Anchoring and Adjustment: Anchoring is the tendency to rely heavily on the first piece of information we encounter (the \"anchor\") when making judgments, and adjust from that starting point rather than relying on more relevant information. This can lead to biases in judgment, as subsequent information is interpreted in a way that is biased towards the anchor.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>framing effect: This refers to the tendency of individuals to make different choices depending on how information is presented, often influenced by the framing of the decision. Factors like whether the frame is positive or negative, or the presentation of gains or losses can significantly impact decisions.</p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<p>Availability Cascade: This phenomenon refers to how collective perceptions can be formed and reinforced by the availability of information. When something becomes widely discussed (often due to dramatic or emotional events), it becomes more prominent in people's minds and can lead to a self-perpetuating belief that something is more true or relevant than it may actually be. </p>\n",
       "</li>\n",
       "</ol>\n",
       "<p>These are some of the key areas of research and findings from Kahnemann and Tversky's theory, offering important insights into how humans think, choose, and make decisions, and the potential pitfalls and biases that can affect these processes. </p>"

He is also known for his work in behavioral economics, for which he was awarded the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences together with Vernon L. Smith. Kahneman's published empirical findings challenge the assumption of human rationality prevailing in modern economic theory. Kahneman became known as the \"grandfather of behavioral economics.\"\n",
       "With Amos Tversky and others, Kahneman established a cognitive basis for common human errors that arise from heuristics and biases, and developed prospect theory. In 2011, Kahneman was named by Foreign Policy magazine in its list of top global thinkers. In the same year, his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, which summarizes much of his research, was published and became a best seller. In 2015, The Economist listed him as the seventh most influential economist in the world.\n",
       "Kahneman was professor emeritus of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University's Princeton School of Public and International Affairs.

       "\"Page: David Beckham\\nSummary: David Robert Joseph Beckham  ( BEK-əm; born 2 May 1975) is an English former professional footballer, the president and co-owner of Inter Miami CF and co-owner of Salford City. Primarily a right winger and known for his range of passing, crossing ability and free-kick taking, Beckham has been hailed as one of the greatest and most recognisable midfielders of his generation, as well as one of the best free-kick takers of all time. He won 19 major trophies in his career, and is the first English player to win league titles in four different countries: England, Spain, the United States and France.\\nBeckham's professional club career began with Manchester United, where he made his first-team debut in 1992 at age 17. With United, he won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice, the FA Charity Shield twice, the Intercontinental Cup and the UEFA Champions League in 1999. He then played four seasons with Real Madrid, winning the La Liga championship in his final season with the club. In July 2007, Beckham signed a five-year contract with Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy. While a Galaxy player, he spent two loan spells in Italy with AC Milan in 2009 and 2010. He became the first British footballer to play 100 UEFA Champions League games. He retired in May 2013 after a 20-year career.\\nIn international football, Beckham made his England debut on 1 September 1996, at the age of 21. He was captain for six years, earning 58 caps during his tenure. He made 115 career appearances in total, appearing at three FIFA World Cups in 1998, 2002 and 2006 as well as two UEFA European Championships in 2000 and 2004. Beckham held the England appearance record for an outfield player until 2016.\\nA global ambassador of football, Beckham is considered to be a British cultural icon. He has been in a well publicised marriage to Victoria Beckham since 1999 and was consistently ranked among the highest earners in football, in 2013 being listed as the highest-paid player in the world having earned over $50 million in the previous twelve months. Beckham was runner-up in the Ballon d'Or in 1999, twice runner-up for FIFA World Player of the Year (1999 and 2001) and in 2004 was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players. He was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2008, and the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2021. He has been a UNICEF ambassador since 2005, and in 2015 he launched 7: The David Beckham UNICEF Fund. In 2014, MLS announced that Beckham and a group of investors would own Inter Miami, which began playing in 2020.\\n\\n\""
